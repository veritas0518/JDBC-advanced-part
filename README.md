# JDBC-advanced-part
I'm going to work again tomorrow. I really don't want to go to work. Now I'm in a strange circle. I'm very anxious, but I don't know why. English is really too difficult. I really don't know whether I can adapt to the study and life in Britain. I'm really a complex of spears and shields. I feel that there are too many things to do. To get down to business, today's content is the advanced part of JDBC, which is still very, very difficult. I can't believe that I have to combine all the things I have learned in the future. At that time, I really don't know what to do. The framework is enough for me to learn all my life, and it's impossible to combine all the things I have learned. Why is life so difficult? I don't want to provide for the aged in state-owned enterprises. I can only be trapped in the quagmire of the Internet. It's ironic. I hated being a programmer before. Now I'm a programmer again. It's true that people will always live like they hate most.
